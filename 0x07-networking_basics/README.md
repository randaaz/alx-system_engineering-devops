# 0x07. Networking basics #0

## Overview
This project focuses on networking basics, covering essential concepts such as the OSI model, different types of networks, LAN and WAN, Internet, MAC address, IP address, IPv4 and IPv6, localhost, TCP and UDP, TCP/UDP ports, ping/ICMP, positional parameters, and more. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of network principles and protocols.

### Man or help:
- `netstat`
- `ping`

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without external assistance:
- OSI Model: What it is, how many layers it has, how it is organized
- LAN: Typical usage, typical geographical size
- WAN: Typical usage, typical geographical size
- Internet
- IP address: What it is, two types of IP addresses
- Localhost
- Subnet
- Why IPv6 was created
- TCP/UDP: Mainly used data transfer protocols for IP, main difference between TCP and UDP
- Port: What it is, memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers
- Tool/protocol often used to check if a device is connected to a network
