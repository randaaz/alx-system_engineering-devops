Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from Apr 8, 2024, 8:00 AM to Apr 8, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC).
Impact: The authentication service was down, resulting in users being unable to log in. Approximately 50% of users were affected.
Timeline:
8:00 AM: The issue was detected when users reported being unable to log in.
8:05 AM: The incident response team received automated alerts indicating a high volume of failed login attempts.
8:10 AM: Engineers began investigating potential causes, focusing on the authentication service and related infrastructure.
8:30 AM: Initial investigations pointed towards a possible database connection issue.
9:00 AM: Database logs were analyzed, but no abnormalities were found.
9:30 AM: Network connectivity tests were conducted, ruling out network-related issues.
10:00 AM: Escalation was made to the database administration and network engineering teams for further assistance.
10:30 AM: The root cause was identified and the incident was resolved.
Actions Taken:
The incident response team investigated the authentication service, database connections, and network configurations.
Database logs were analyzed, and network connectivity tests were performed.
No concrete evidence was found through initial investigations.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
Initial focus on database connections and network configurations did not yield any evidence of the root cause.
Escalation:
The incident was escalated to the database administration and network engineering teams for additional support.
Resolution:
The incident was resolved by identifying a misconfiguration in the authentication service's configuration files. An incorrect parameter was causing authentication failures.
The misconfiguration was corrected, and the authentication service was restored at 10:30 AM.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's configuration files, leading to authentication failures.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by reverting the incorrect parameter to its previous state, restoring the functionality of the authentication service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes: To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
Strengthening Configuration Management: Implement additional checks and reviews for configuration changes to minimize the risk of misconfigurations.
Automated Configuration Validation: Enhance automated validation processes to detect misconfigurations in real-time.
Regular Configuration Audits: Conduct regular audits of configuration files to identify and rectify any potential issues proactively.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Perform a comprehensive review of configuration management practices and implement additional controls.
Enhance automated monitoring and alerting systems to provide early detection of configuration-related issues.
Conduct training sessions for the operations team to increase awareness of proper configuration management practices.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the outage incident was caused by a misconfiguration in the authentication service, resulting in authentication failures for users. The incident was promptly resolved by correcting the misconfiguration, and measures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future through improved configuration management practices and enhanced monitoring systems.
